The horses kicked and flicked their tails at flies, not caring about their owner's first visit in ten months. Sam waited. Mr Carter didn't come out here unless he had to, which was just fine by Sam. The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job.\n\nCarter came by later while Sam was chopping wood. Carter lifted his hat as if he were waiting for an appointment with the town priest, and then removed it completely as if he were talking to his mother. He pulled out a pile of paper from his back pocket and held it out.\n\n'Don't pick up your mail often, do you?'\n\nSam took it without a glance and dropped the envelopes onto the bench.\n\n'Never,' he replied and waited for Carter to say why he was here. The fact it was Carter's house was no explanation and they both knew it. Carter twisted his hat round and round, licking his lips and clearing his throat.\n\n'Nice work fixing those fences,' he said finally.\n\n'I'll be back to the beginning soon,' Sam said. It wasn't a complaint. A fence that took a year to repair meant another year's work to the man who did it well.\n\n'Don't you ever want to take a holiday?'\n\n'And go where?' A holiday meant being back out in the real world, a place even people like Carter travelled to escape from. Sam's escape was his reality and he wasn't going back.\n\nMr Carter wiped the sweat from the back of his neck. The damp patches on his shirt drew together like shapes in an atlas. His skin was already turning ruddy in the June sun. Otherwise he had the indoor tan of a man that made money while other people did the work.\n\n'I've brought my son with me on this trip. He's had some trouble at school.' Mr Carter's eyes flicked up, blinked rapidly and then shifted back to the hat occupying his hands. 'Not much trouble out here for a young boy.' He attempted a laugh but it came out like a dog's bark.\n\nThe two men looked towards the northern end of the property. It stretched as far as the eye could see. Even the fences were barely visible from where they stood. However bored and rebellious a teenage boy might get, it wasn't possible to escape on foot. Sam looked at the biggest of the horses, kicking at the ground with its heavy hooves. Could the boy ride? he wondered. There was a whole load of trouble a good rider could get into out here, miles away from anyone. But maybe there was even more trouble for someone who knew nothing about horses and wanted to get away from his father.\n\n","likes":[{"$oid":"657f72094ef3b2bebbada9a8"},{"$oid":"658a004bcfe25012196f9834"},{"$oid":"65945f60103467a794dfff2e"},{"$oid":"657f3f8c1e4d0b5f3d7e16cb"}],"date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1704730865135"}},"__v":{"$numberInt":"4"}},{"_id":{"$oid":"659c98f782f0c6af0504d62c"},"email":"purvi@gmail.com","title":"How to set up a local Node.js dev environment","content":"# Step 1: Fork the Code Repository\nThe first thing we want to do is download the code to our local development machine. Let’s do this using the following git command:\n\n- git clone https://github.com/rumpl/memphis.git\n\nNow that we have the code local, let’s take a look at the project structure. Open the code in your favorite IDE and expand the root level directories. You’ll see the following file structure.\n\n├── docker-compose.yml  \n├── notes-service  \n├── reading-list-service  \n├── users-service  \n└── yoda-ui  \n\nThe application is made up of a couple of simple microservices and a front-end written in React.js. It also uses MongoDB as its datastore.\n\nTypically at this point, we would start a local version of MongoDB or look through the project to find where our applications will be looking for MongoDB. Then, we would start each of our microservices independently and start the UI in hopes that the default configuration works.\n\nHowever, this can be very complicated and frustrating. Especially if our microservices are using different versions of Node.js and configured differently.\n\nInstead, let’s walk through making this process easier by dockerizing our application and putting our database into a container. \n\n# Step 2: Dockerize your applications\nDocker is a great way to provide consistent development environments. It will allow us to run each of our services and UI in a container. We’ll also set up things so that we can develop locally and start our dependencies with one docker command.\n\nThe first thing we want to do is dockerize each of our applications. Let’s start with the microservices because they are all written in Node.js, and we’ll be able to use the same Dockerfile.\n\n","likes":[{"$oid":"658a004bcfe25012196f9834"}],"date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1704761591347"}},"__v":{"$numberInt":"1"}},{"_id":{"$oid":"659c99f782f0c6af0504d655"},"email":"nata@gmail.com","title":"How To Cook Rice","content":"Just can't master the art of cooking rice on the stovetop? No stress—you're not alone. Many things can go wrong when prepping rice: too gummy, too hard, burnt. But, once you've got it down, it's simple to get it right every time. Before you know it, you'll have a steaming bowl of rice ready to be made into our easy Buddha bowls or topped with beef and broccoli for the easiest weeknight dinner. \n\nFollow our steps with our top tips and tricks to master rice on the stovetop every time: \n\n## 1. Rinse the rice.\n\nUgh, I know, rinsing is annoying, but it really is worth it to get rid of the dusty starches that may make the rice too sticky. Just place your rice in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear.\n\n## 2. Remember the ratio. \n\nFor most types of rice, you'll always use a ratio of 1 cup rice to 2 cups water, which you can scale up or down. (Double-check your rice packaging to be sure.) Feel free to swap in chicken or vegetable broth for more flavor.\n\n## 3. Bring the water to a boil\n\nThen, stir in your rice and salt. And if you want to add a tab of butter, too, go for it — your rice will taste 10x better.\n\n## 4. Get a steady simmer.\n\nAfter adding the rice, the temperature of your water will drop significantly, and it'll stop boiling. Let it come back to a gentle simmer (otherwise you run the risk of your water cooking off faster than your rice gets tender).\n\n## 5. Don't take off the lid. \n\nCover the saucepan and reduce heat to low. Though it will be tempting, keep the lid on! It's very important not to mess with the steam. \n\n## 6. Check at 18 minutes. \n\nFor long grain white rice, I always set a timer for 18, knowing that it could need another minute or two. Let the rice be your indicator, not the water. If there's a little water leftover, it's totally fine! Just tilt the saucepan slightly to drain it out. (Cooking brown rice? Check at 30 minutes.)\n\n## 7. Leave it alone. \n\nTurn off the heat, replace the lid, and let it rest for a few minutes in the steamy saucepan. Patience is a virtue, my friend. \n\n## 8. Fluff it up!\n\nUse a fork to gently mix and lift rice to make sure that the grains don't stick together. \n\nIf you have a rice cooker, the game is a lot easier. Use the same magic ratio and throw everything into the rice cooker, which does all the work for you. When the machine says it's ready, the same \"leave it alone\" and fluffing instructions apply.  \n\n","likes":[],"date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1704761847894"}},"__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}},{"_id":{"$oid":"659ca097ed9cdc9fe4e305ed"},"email":"one@gmail.com","title":"Why bridges collapse","content":"Some of the biggest and most expensive transportation projects in the world have involved building bridges. Bridges are crucial links that carry cars, trucks and trains across bodies of water, mountain gorges or other roads. As a result, they are one of the most important aspects of civil engineering and are subject to intense scrutiny, especially when they collapse.\n\nBridge collapses can be tragic events, leading to loss of life and serious property damage. That's why bridge engineers, designers and builders must always take their jobs very seriously. The best way for them to prevent these accidents is to understand why bridges collapse in the first place. Understanding bridge collapses can lead to major changes in the design, construction and safety of future building projects. The following are main reasons why bridges fall.\n\n## Fire\nHistorically, more bridges were made of wood and were much more susceptible to fire. This was particularly true of old-fashioned train bridges, where the spark created by the steel wheels and steel tracks could sometimes cause a bridge to catch fire and burn to the ground.\n\n## During construction\nA large number of bridge accidents occur during the construction of the bridge itself. These accidents are often due to an error made by the engineers, such as a miscalculation. The bridge collapses under its own weight, and this can be deadly for the workers on it at the time.\n\n## Earthquakes\nEarthquakes damage all structures, including bridges. Luckily, this kind of collapse is relatively infrequent, especially with modern bridges. Engineers have learned to design bridges in earthquake zones on areas that are much more resistant to movement.\n\n## By defect\nSome bridge collapses are mysteries, and engineers only realise why after they conduct a complete investigation. In some cases, this could happen because inferior-quality material was used in the construction, or because of a defect in a key piece of the bridge. In other cases, the bridge was designed only to support a certain amount of weight and no more.\n\n## Boat or train crash\nBoth of these kinds of accidents are extremely rare, but boats and trains can cause a bridge to collapse for different reasons. With trains, it's the velocity of the impact that can bring a bridge down. With boats, it's the very large mass they have that can bring about the collapse, even if they are moving very slowly when it occurs.\n\nThe best way to avoid bridge failures is to plan for them. Modern technologies that can detect structural weakness, safer working environments and better designs can all help to reduce these terrible accidents.","likes":[{"$oid":"657f3f8c1e4d0b5f3d7e16cb"},{"$oid":"65945f60103467a794dfff2e"}],"date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1704763543776"}},"__v":{"$numberInt":"2"}},{"_id":{"$oid":"659e0302c406d2b41767a449"},"email":"purvi@gmail.com","title":"Unveiling the Power of Semiconductors: The Heart of Modern Electronics","content":"Semiconductors, the unsung heroes of the digital age, play a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of modern electronics.
